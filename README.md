# About the video

In this tutorial you'll learn how to create a simple but powerfull Content Management System (CMS) from scratch in ASP.NET Core 2.2.

This tutorial is a good start if you know the basics of C# but want to learn the next step in how to apply that knowledge if it comes to building data driven web applications.

The CMS will consist of a simple frontend and a secure backend using ASP.NET Core Identity.

We're using the following technologies:

- ASP.NET Core 2.2
- Entity Framework Core
- ASP.NET Core Identity
- Bootstrap 4

And I'm using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition with [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) installed.
